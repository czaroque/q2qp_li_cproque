                <h1>Who We Are</h1>
                <p>As an NGO for children in the Philippines, we believe that street children are created in the image of the Supreme Being with inherent worth and dignity. Therefore, they have the right to live and be protected from any form of abuse. They should be given opportunities to express themselves and maximize their potentials to help themselves and others. We envision a Philippines where urban poor children can gain access to the fulfillment of their rights especially children in street situations. For them to develop and become accepted responsible members of society, they should be upheld and protected. Childhope Philippines works toward the protection and fulfillment of children’s rights. Through integrated direct service programs in education, health, and social services, we aim for the holistic growth of Filipino street children in Metro Manila.</p>
