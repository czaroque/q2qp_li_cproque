                <h1>Initiatives</h1>
                <p>We also provide educational aid to children who go back to the formal school system. For our older participants, we conduct trade and tech skills training (Youth Empowerment Project) to help them gain income to support themselves and their families. <br> <br>We provide psychosocial aid and counseling. We help the kids and their parents cope up with stress and the challenges that they encounter while learning. Moreover, we provide assistance to shelters especially to those with completely neglected and abandoned children. <br> <br> The Mobile Health Clinic (KliniKalye) provides primary preventive medical care, consultations, and treatments. This ensures that the children are healthy and in full physical capacity to learn. <br> <br> We train the street children in leadership, computer literacy, sports, arts, and other skills. We help them develop these skills, nurture their good traits, and apply the values they have learned in life planning.</p>
